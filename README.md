# Mecanum Car Project  

## üìñ Overview  
This project involves a **Mecanum-wheeled vehicle** controlled by a **Raspberry Pi Pico** and **Bluetooth** communication. The Mecanum wheels allow omnidirectional movement (forward, backward, sideways, and diagonally), offering exceptional maneuverability.  

The project integrates **embedded systems programming** with control logic for precise motor control and real-time command processing via Bluetooth.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### 1. **Clone the repository:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/martowicz/mecanum_car.git
```

### 2. **Hardware Requirements:**  
- **Raspberry Pi Pico**  
- **Mecanum wheels with motors**  
- **Motor driver module (compatible with the Pico)**  
- **Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05)**

## üîß Setup and Installation  
1. **Connect the components:**  
   - Connect the motors to the motor driver.  
   - Connect the motor driver and Bluetooth module to the Raspberry Pi Pico according to the circuit diagram.  
   
2. **Flash the code:**  
   - Install [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) or another MicroPython IDE.  
   - Flash MicroPython firmware on the Raspberry Pi Pico.  
   - Upload the project files to the Pico.

3. **Bluetooth pairing:**  
   - Pair the Bluetooth module with your mobile device.  
   - Use a compatible app to send movement commands (forward, backward, rotate, etc.).
